### About Me

I’m Hirut, currently, I am working as PPC specialist at [](). I’m passionate about web development and really enjoy learning programming languages and frameworks (React). 
I build lots of demos on this account and the @learnwithjason organization. Most of them are built live on Learn With Jason, a live-streamed pair programming show where super smart people join to teach us something new in 90 minutes.
